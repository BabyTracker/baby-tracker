# Babimemo â€” an app for recording memories

This project is single page web application with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) on the front-end and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) on the back-end. This app serves as a place in which you can track and record your child's memories.


## Project Set-up

To get you started you can simply clone the baby-tracker repository and install the dependencies:

### Cloning the Repository

You can clone this project down from the baby-tracker repository from github.
```
git clone https://github.com/BabyTracker/baby-tracker
cd angular-seed
```

### Install Dependencies - AngularJS

There are multiple dependencies in this project: tools, angular framework code.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

Both `npm` and  `bower`  are configured to automatically run upon typing:

```
npm install
```

This also calls `bower install` which will create two new folders in your project:

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

### Run Front-end During Development

You can start the server by typing:
```
npm start
```
You can now browse to the app locally at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.

This project also comes a local development web server. You can start this web server by using `npm start`:

```
sudo npm install
```

Then you can choose to configure your own webserver, such as apache or nginx. Just configure your server to serve the files under the `app/` directory.



### Install Dependencies - Django


Next, install your virtual environment, virtual environment wrapper and pip. We suggest using the combined installer brainsik's [virtualenv-burrito](https://github.com/brainsik/virtualenv-burrito) found on github. Once inside of your virtual environment, you can install the dependencies found in the requirements.txt file.
```
(yourvenv) $ pip install django
(yourvenv) $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
```


## Basic User Authentication
This app contains a basic level of user authentication, based on the built-in Django user authentication module. While the authentication of this app does not allow for password and email verification, it allow for new users to sign-up and then simultaneously logs them in. It allows for users to maintain separation between another user's children and memories.



### Make those memories!
We hope you enjoy our simple app that gives you a way track your child's most important memories.
